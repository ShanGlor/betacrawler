Betacrawler TODO
====

Thing we would like to see implemented in the future:

  - Implement a pan/title feature for a camera gyimbol
  - Allow AUX1 and AUX2 to be mapped to various functions (AUX1 is only arm at this stage)
  - Implement a working CLI script with interupts?



Done
=======

  - The cli (Command.cpp) object has been disabled as the Serial rx/tx 
    get corupted with the PPM interupt signal. If there is a fix let me know?
