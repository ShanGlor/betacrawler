Introduction
====

Betacrawler is a basic tank control system for using a PPM receiver
to control ESC and brushless motors.

It has 2 modes of operation:
  - Mode 1: __Dual Throttle__ allows for the use of both sticks to control the left and right 
            motors individually
  - Mode 2: __Single Stick__ allows you to use a single stick to control the left right
            motors as a mix leaving the other stick availalbe for other operations
